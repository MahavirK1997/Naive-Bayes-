# Naive Bayes Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files implementing Naive Bayes algorithms from scratch using only the Numpy library.

## 1. Gaussian Naive Bayes

### File: GaussianNaiveBayes.ipynb

This notebook includes the code for the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. The implementation is designed to handle any number of variables and classes. It is written entirely using the Numpy library, providing a clear and educational insight into the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm.

#### Features:
- Suitable for any number of variables.
- Handles any number of classes.

## 2. Naive Bayes for Categorical Variables

### File: NaiveBayes.ipynb

This notebook focuses on the Naive Bayes algorithm for categorical variables. The implementation is specifically designed for binary variables and includes Laplace Transform to enhance performance. Like the Gaussian Naive Bayes implementation, this code is written from scratch using only Numpy.

#### Features:
- Tailored for binary variables.
- Includes Laplace Transform for improved performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the respective Jupyter Notebook file based on the Naive Bayes algorithm you want to explore.
3. Run the cells and explore the code.
4. Modify or adapt the code for your specific use case or integrate it into your projects.
