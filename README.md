This repository includes 2 ipynb files. 


***Gaussian Naive Bayes***

The first file namely GaussianNaiveBayes includes the code for Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm written from scratch using only Numpy library. 

This code can work on any number of variables and any number of classes. 


***Naive Bayes***

The second file is for Naive Bayes algorithm for categorical variables written from scratch using numpy only.

This code is for only binary variables. However, this includes Laplace Transform as well.
